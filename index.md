This digital garden template is free and open-source. It runs on Apache servers and the [Github code is available here](https://github.com/meewgumi/apache-digital-garden). You can set up deploy actions and Jekyll build commands via Github Actions, or my personal favorite, [DeployHQ](https://www.deployhq.com/). This version of the code was modified by [Megumi Tanaka](https://megumi.co) in 2021.
