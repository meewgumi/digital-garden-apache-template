## Settings
### Files & Links
- Set default location for new notes to `_notes`
- Set default location for attachments to `assets`

## Writing
When using Wikilinks, ensure that you're selecting notes in the `_notes` directory so the Jekyll build command works properly. Since we can't [ignore Obsidian folders yet](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/ignore-a-folder-of-temporary-notes/4473/8), you might prefer to open the `_notes` folder as your primary vault. This means you'll have to edit static pages like `about.md` in Atom.
